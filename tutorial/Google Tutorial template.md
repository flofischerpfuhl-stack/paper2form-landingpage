# Create Form
1. Go to https://docs.google.com/forms
2. Create a new empty form *1 Screenshot Placeholder*
3. Create fileds for the information you need from your paper documents. 
	You can recreate all the fields from your physical form here, or you can pursue a more generalized unstructured approach. For example you could create a Form for physical Mail,where oen of your fields is "Summary of Conetent", and the AI will automatically summarize the letter you received.
	For this example well stay with a more stuctured form. We want to digitize the answers to a volunteer registration form, so we create a field for every question in the paperform that is relevant to us. *2 Screenshot Placeholder*
4. We want to have all documents listet in a table, so in the answers tab we click on "Link to Google Sheets" and we select either a new or an allready existing Sheets document.*1 Screenshot Placeholder*
5. After that we just need to click "publish". If the Person using the Paper2Form App is not the Author of the Form, you need to esure he has access, by either adding his gmail adress or by keeping the form public. Also if he is not the autor you need to copy the link and send it to him *1 Screenshot Placeholder*

# Import Form
1. In the Paper2Form app you need to login with your Google Account two times. First with the Google Authetication dialogue and then in the WebView.*4 Screenshot Placeholder*
2. To add the Form we just created you can slect it by browsing your forms if your the author. if not, you paste the link if the form here.*2 Screenshot Placeholder*

# Scan document
1. Now you can fill out your form. manual fill lets you type in the form by hand. Single scan is the fastest, it just takes one photo and fills out the form. If your document has multiple pages, or you want to process multiple docuemnts in parallel you can choose "Scan (multiple)"*3 Screenshot Placeholder*
2. Once the photos are processed you can verify and correct any possible mistakes and the just click on send*1 Screenshot Placeholder*
3. the responses will pop up emideatily in the google sheets tabel*1 Screenshot Placeholder*

3. under "performance" you can choose scan quality and resolution. higher values will mean better results but longer processing time *1 Screenshot Placeholder*

# subscription
