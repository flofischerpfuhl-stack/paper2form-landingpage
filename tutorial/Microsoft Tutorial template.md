# Create Form
1. Go to https://forms.cloud.microsoft/
2. Create a new empty form *1 Screenshot Placeholder*
3. Create fileds for the information you need from your paper documents. 
	You can recreate all the fields from your physical form here, or you can pursue a more generalized unstructured approach. For example you could create a Form for physical Mail,where oen of your fields is "Summary of Conetent", and the AI will automatically summarize the letter you received.
	For this example well stay with a more stuctured form. We want to digitize the answers to a volunteer registration form, so we create a field for every question in the paperform that is relevant to us. *2 Screenshot Placeholder*
4. After that we just need to click "collect answers". If the Person using the Paper2Form App is not the Author of the Form, you need to esure he has access, by either adding his microsoft account or by keeping the form public. *1 Screenshot Placeholder*
5. it is important that you activate a prefilled link. if the person using paper2form is not the author you can copy the prefilled link and send it to him

# Import Form
1. In the Paper2Form app you need to login with your Microsoft Account in the WebView.*2 Screenshot Placeholder*
2. To add the Form we just created you can slect it by browsing your forms in the webview and copying the prefilled link if your the author. if not, you paste the link of the prefilled form.*2 Screenshot Placeholder*

# Scan document
1. Now you can fill out your form. manual fill lets you type in the form by hand. Single scan is the fastest, it just takes one photo and fills out the form. If your document has multiple pages, or you want to process multiple docuemnts in parallel you can choose "Scan (multiple)"*3 Screenshot Placeholder*
2. Once the photos are processed you can verify and correct any possible mistakes and then just click on send*1 Screenshot Placeholder*
3. after sending the first response, you can now link the responses to an excel tabele. from now on any new respose will autimatically appear here. *2 Screenshot Placeholder*
